    "# Step 2: Preparation of Historical Data from CEX and DeFi\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll prepare historical data from centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Specifically, we will pull data from Aave Lending for DeFi information and Binance Trading for CEX data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this, we will use the `TokenDataFinder` class from the `data_prepare.py` module, which automates the process of locating and extracting time ranges from CSV files in specified folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Overview of `TokenDataFinder` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TokenDataFinder` class is designed to:\n",
    "1. **Locate CSV Files**: It searches the specified folders for CSV files containing historical data.\n",
    "2. **Extract Date Ranges**: It reads the first and last rows of each CSV file to determine the range of available data.\n",
    "3. **Identify Data Paths**: It differentiates between data from Aave Lending and Binance Trading (both SPOT and PERP markets).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code for `TokenDataFinder` from `data_prepare.py`. We’ll use its methods to gather data for each token across Aave Lending and Binance Trading platforms.\n"

    "   - This category includes news events that are deemed to have a \"significant rise\" impact on the token’s price.\n",
    "   - These news articles are identified based on sentiment analysis, where the content suggests a potential positive effect on the token’s future price.\n",
    "   - For instance, BTC had 16 such rise events within this period, indicating frequent positive sentiment articles that may influence its price in the near term.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Fall Impact News**:\n",
    "   - This category includes news events that are classified as having a \"fall\" impact on the token’s price.\n",
    "   - These articles, as determined by the sentiment analysis, imply a potentially negative effect on the token’s future price.\n",
    "   - For example, LINK had 22 fall impact news events within the same period, signaling the presence of considerable negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methodology and Criteria\n",
    "The identification and classification of news into \"Rise\" and \"Fall\" categories are based on a combination of sentiment analysis and historical context. This approach introduces an **innovative filtering mechanism** that separates impactful news from retrospective reports, enhancing the relevance and actionability of the insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **News Sentiment Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Each news article is processed using a custom prompt in the OpenAI model, which categorizes sentiment into five levels: \"significant rise,\" \"rise,\" \"neutral,\" \"fall,\" and \"significant fall.\"\n",
    "   - Only articles with a \"significant rise\" or \"fall\" sentiment are selected to populate the rise and fall events lists, respectively, ensuring that only the most impactful news is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filtering Retrospective News**:\n",
    "   - An innovative aspect of this methodology is the filtering of news that contains primarily retrospective information, such as reports that BTC has already reached a specific level. These retrospective news articles are less likely to impact future price movements and are therefore excluded, ensuring that only forward-looking insights contribute to the backtesting results.\n",
    "   - This selective approach not only improves the quality of the backtesting process but also creates opportunities for **real-time response**, a critical capability in modern trading and DeFi environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agentic Capabilities**:\n",
    "   - By capturing only the most relevant forward-looking news, this method aligns well with the requirements for deploying autonomous agents, such as **Atlas, Ganesh, or Apollo**, that can interact with DeFi primitives and LLMs. This enables the development of agents capable of real-time adaptation to sentiment shifts, making the strategy highly responsive and effective in dynamic market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deduplication and Skipping**:\n",
    "   - If the relevant data already exists (for example, in sentiment analysis CSVs or rise/fall JSON files), the code skips reprocessing to ensure efficiency and consistency in results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Backtesting\n",
    "The rise and fall impact dates stored in JSON files provide a list of key sentiment-driven events, which can be used to simulate the influence of news on the tokens during the backtesting period. By focusing on news with a future-oriented impact, this methodology enables a more realistic testing environment for evaluating trading strategies based on external news sentiment. This approach also lays a strong foundation for building robust agent-based strategies, paving the way for a pseudocode implementation that could interact with DeFi primitives, LLMs, and on-chain data sources for comprehensive market analysis and strategic decision-making.\n"

    "## Step 4: Backtesting Strategy and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the limited backtesting period and specific news volume per token, the focus was on a primary trading pair with an effective yet straightforward trading strategy. This approach facilitated robust analysis of market reactions to sentiment signals, liquidity data, and technical indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "The methodology involved testing multiple strategies to achieve a balance between simplicity and effectiveness. An optimal strategy was selected based on the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strategy Design**:\n",
    "   - The strategy enters a buy position when a token has a \"Rise Impact\" news signal, indicating potential upward price movement.\n",
    "   - After entering a position, the strategy monitors the token's price using predefined exit conditions to minimize downside risk while maximizing upside potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exit Conditions**:\n",
    "   - A position is closed when:\n",
    "     - A \"Fall Impact\" news signal is detected, suggesting a potential negative price movement.\n",
    "     - The price reaches the upper Bollinger Band on a 1-hour timeframe, adjusted by a model parameter defining the take-profit level.\n",
    "     - The price falls to a Stop Loss level calculated based on the lower Bollinger Band.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bollinger Bands and Adaptive Parameters**:\n",
    "   - Bollinger Bands are utilized to dynamically set take-profit and stop-loss levels based on market volatility.\n",
    "   - Parameters (`sl_level` and `tp_level`) allow for adjustments to Bollinger Band levels, enabling flexibility in response to market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtesting Process\n",
    "The backtesting is conducted using the Backtrader library, which efficiently handles historical data and real-time backtesting capabilities. Key steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - Historical data from CEX and DeFi platforms is pre-processed for consistency across timestamps and value formats.\n",
    "   - Pre-aggregated news impact dates and sentiment are loaded for each token, simulating realistic trading signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strategy Initialization**:\n",
    "   - The strategy initializes with a starting balance and parameters for position sizing, precision, and the backtesting period.\n",
    "   - Sentiment data (Rise and Fall Impact News) is loaded for each token to ensure the strategy responds to relevant events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Execution and Monitoring**:\n",
    "   - The strategy enters buy positions based on \"Rise Impact\" news signals and monitors the market using Bollinger Bands and stop-loss conditions.\n",
    "   - Each position's metrics (entry/exit prices, portfolio value) are tracked for performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Backtesting results include key metrics such as Total Trades, Win/Loss ratio, Gross/Net Profit, and Sharpe Ratio.\n",
    "   - These metrics evaluate the strategy’s effectiveness and risk-adjusted returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "This strategy demonstrates an innovative approach by leveraging sentiment signals while filtering out retrospective news events. This allows for real-time responsiveness and supports the development of agents such as **Atlas, Ganesh, or Apollo**, which can interact with DeFi primitives and LLMs for refined trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Currently, the console outputs summarized information for the primary token. However, the code allows full backtesting for other tokens given sufficient data and a larger timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While this strategy shows excellent results, it's important to recognize that for a more relevant evaluation of the Sharpe Ratio and other metrics like the Sortino Ratio, testing over longer timeframes is necessary. This requires additional work and potentially purchasing paid API versions, including news sources.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we have developed a comprehensive backtesting framework leveraging an order book and historical financial datasets to create a detailed analysis of our trading strategy. The primary focus was on data aggregation, strategy design, and backtesting results, with future enhancements to allow for the development of agents like **Atlas**, **Ganesh**, or **Apollo**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Our backtesting results provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the Trading Strategy implemented. The significant metrics obtained from the testing period are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Final Portfolio Value**: $10,170.57\n",
    "- **PnL**: 1.71%\n",
    "- **Price Change for the Period**: -1.85% (from $65,173.99 to $63,967.99)\n",
    "- **Total Trades**: 6\n",
    "- **Closed Trades**: 6\n",
    "- **Gross PnL**: $170.57\n",
    "- **Net PnL**: $170.57\n",
    "- **Wins**: 4\n",
    "- **Losses**: 2\n",
    "- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.41\n",
